### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying to be a fullstack software engineer. I'm interested in web and app development for speech science and medical applications. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist and former actor/voice coach.

Fun fact: I can recite several Mel Brooks films almost entirely by memory.
