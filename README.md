## Hi, I'm Dara. Welcome! ðŸ˜€

I am a full-stack engineer comfortable with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, Redux, and PostgreSQL. I am interested in web and healthcare application development, including both patient-facing and provider-facing software. I am also a licensed speech-language pathologist and former actor.
