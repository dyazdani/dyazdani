### Welcome! ðŸ˜€

Iâ€™m currently studying to be a full-stack software engineer. I'm interested in a wide range of areas including speech therapy apps, and other medical applications that improve people's lives. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist and former actor/voice coach.

Fun fact: I can recite several Mel Brooks films by heart.
