# Hi, I'm Dara. Welcome! ðŸ˜€

## About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer in web, working mostly with JavaScript, React, and Node. I am especially interested in the healthcare tech space â€“â€“ I have a background in the medical industry from my previous work as a licensed speech-language pathologist. 

I bring an empathetic approach to developing my own software. In my work as a speech-language pathologist, I listened and empathized with each of my patients in order to arrive at the best possible treatment plan for them. I continue to bring that care and thought to my work.

When I was an actor and director, I loved joining forces with a team of passionate professionals all working towards a mutual goal. That love of teamwork fuels me in my collaboration with other developers on software projects today.
