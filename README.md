### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying to be a fullstack software engineer. I'm interested in web and mobile app development for the fields of speech therapy and other specialties in medicine. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist and former actor/voice coach.

Fun fact: I can recite several Mel Brooks films almost entirely by memory.
